Installation and compatibility
==============================

Craterslab requires Python 3.10+ for functioning. Make sure you have a compliant 
version of `python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ installed in your system.

Installing craterslab from pypi using pip (Recommended) 
-------------------------------------------------------

>>> pip install craterslab

We strongly encourage users using this method to create a 
`virtual environment <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>`_ 
before installing the library.


Installing craterslab from the repository using poetry 
------------------------------------------------------
Make sure you have `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_ in your system 
and then run:

>>> git clone https://github.com/gvieralopez/craterslab.git
>>> cd craterslab
>>> poetry install
>>> poetry shell

These will create and activate an isolated virtual environment with craterslab 
installed on it.
